# Pfa-Résolution du Problème de Maximum Weight Submatrix (MWS) en Utilisant les Méthodes : Random Optimization Algorithm (ROA), Genetic Algorithm (GA) et Evolutionary Programming (EP)

Cancer is a name given to all kind of diseases caused by genetic changes, such as somatic mutations in DNA. These mutations occur during cell division. Genome sequencing is one technique that have been deployed to analyze somatic mutations. Thus, many projects were launched in order to deal with these somatic mutations, for instance The International Cancer Genome Consortium which its aim is to map the genetic mutations of the most dangerous cancer types. In order to assess the data from these projects, one of the challenges in bioinformatics is to find the distinction between driver mutations that lead to tumorigenesis and passenger mutations, which are known to be neutral and does not play any role in cancer development. To solve this problem, several approaches and techniques were used. In this final project (PFA), we used Random Optimization Algorithm (ROA), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolutionary Programming (EP) as an approximate approach in order to solve the so called “Maximum Weight Submatrix (MWS) Problem”. The proposed algorithms will maximize the weight and samples all the possible pathways that can be found using Python language (GUI). A comparison of these approximate methods with an exact method has also been taking into consideration.
